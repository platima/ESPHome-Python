# CLAUDE.md — AI Assistant Context

This file provides project context for AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot,
Claude, etc.). It is read at the start of each session so the assistant
understands the project without re-discovering everything.

## Project Overview

**ESPHome Lights** — A Python daemon + thin CLI client for controlling
ESPHome smart lights and switches via the native ESPHome API.

The project uses a **persistent daemon + thin CLI client** architecture to
achieve sub-100 ms command response times (previously ~4.2 s per invocation
with the monolithic script).

### Architecture

```
CLI client  —(Unix socket)—>  Daemon  —(persistent ESPHome API connections)—>  Devices
```

- **`esphome-lightsd.py`** — Long-running async daemon that keeps ESPHome
  connections alive and listens on a Unix socket for JSON commands.
- **`esphome-lights.py`** — Thin CLI client using only stdlib (`socket`,
  `json`, `sys`, `argparse`). No heavy imports; fast startup.

## Dev Environment

- **Dev machine:** Windows 11 with VS Code as the primary IDE
- **WSL2:** Debian instance available for Linux-native tooling
- **Terminals:** PowerShell in VS Code; Debian WSL2 accessible if needed
- **Deployment target:** Luckfox Pico (ARM Linux SBC), resource-constrained
- **Python interpreter:** System Python 3.13 confirmed working on the Luckfox
  Pico with `aioesphomeapi` 44.0.0. The legacy 3.11 venv is no longer required.
  - **Install `noiseprotocol` in user space** — both `noise` 1.2.2 (Perlin
    noise) and `noiseprotocol` install into the same `noise/` directory.
    Uninstalling `noise` 1.2.2 deletes that directory, silently breaking
    `noiseprotocol`. Fix: `python3.13 -m pip install --force-reinstall noiseprotocol`.
  - The Cython-compiled `.so` files in the pre-built wheel still resolve
    `import noise` at runtime via Python's normal import system — there is no
    static linking. If the `noise/` directory is missing from `sys.path`, the
    import fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'noise'`.

## Device Configuration

Devices are configured via environment variables.

```
ESPHOME_LIGHTS_<LOCATION>="<host>:<port>|<encryption_key>"
```

- Location is lowercased for CLI use.
- Port is typically `6053` (native ESPHome API).

When installed via `install.sh`, config lives at `~/.config/esphome-lights/env`
and is loaded by the systemd unit via `EnvironmentFile=`. For manual runs, the
daemon also loads a `.env` file from one directory above the script as a
fallback.

- Example:
  ```
  ESPHOME_LIGHTS_LIVING_ROOM="10.42.40.55:6053|J+YkHH7XC+4dQwWvPoF5kaz7tP4NY4HJNTL0QyZM1Rg="
  ```

## CLI Interface

```
esphome-lights.py --list                          # List configured lights
esphome-lights.py --status                        # Show on/off state
esphome-lights.py --set <light-id> --on           # Turn on
esphome-lights.py --set <light-id> --off          # Turn off
esphome-lights.py --set <light-id> --brightness N # Set brightness (0-255)
esphome-lights.py --set <light-id> --rgb r,g,b    # Set RGB colour
esphome-lights.py --ping                          # Health check (daemon mode)

Flags:
  --bg, --background   Fire and forget (return immediately)
  --debug              Wait for completion and show detailed results
```

## Entity Handling

- Prefer `LightInfo` entities for brightness/RGB control.
- Fall back to `SwitchInfo` for simple on/off devices (smart plugs, etc.).
- Always skip entities with `object_id == 'status_led'`.
- Brightness and RGB commands return errors for switch-type entities.

## Conventions

### Language

Australian English in **all** comments, log messages, and documentation.
Examples: initialise, behaviour, colour, licence, serialisation, organisation,
optimise, minimise, recognise.

### Versioning (SemVer)

Semantic Versioning tracked in the `VERSION` file at the repo root.

| Bump  | When                                               |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------|
| PATCH | Each individual commit (bug fix, small improvement) |
| MINOR | Phase or milestone complete (push + update README)  |
| MAJOR | Breaking protocol or API change                     |

### Git Workflow

1. Create a **feature or fix branch** off `master` (`feature/<name>`, `fix/<name>`).
2. Make changes, commit with a **Conventional Commits** message
   (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`).
3. **Bump the PATCH** version in `VERSION` with each commit.
4. When the phase/milestone is complete: bump **MINOR**, update `README.md`,
   commit, and push.
5. Merge back to `master`.

### Documentation & Testing

- **Update docs with every change.** If a feature, config, or file changes,
  update `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and inline comments in the same commit.
- **Create documentation if it's missing.** Never leave a new subsystem
  undocumented.
- **Update `TODO.md`** when tasks are completed or new work is identified.
  This file is the persistent plan - if a session is lost, the next session
  picks up from `TODO.md`.

### Standard Task Completion Checklist

Every piece of work (feature, fix, refactor) must complete **all** of these
steps before the task is considered done. Do not skip steps, and do not batch
them silently — each must be visible in the plan.

1. Implement the change.
2. Update or create unit tests to cover the change.
3. Run unit tests — fix and repeat until all pass.
4. Update inline code comments (Australian English).
5. Update `README.md` if the change affects usage, structure, or config.
6. Update `CLAUDE.md` if the change affects project context.
7. Update `TODO.md` — mark completed items, add new items if identified.
8. Bump version in `VERSION` (PATCH per commit, MINOR per milestone).
9. `git add -A && git commit` with a Conventional Commits message.
10. At milestone completion: bump MINOR, push, update README version.

## Build & Test

- **No build step** — pure Python, interpreted.
- **Dependencies:** `aioesphomeapi` (daemon only; CLI client is stdlib-only).
- **Running the daemon:**
  ```bash
  python3 esphome-lightsd.py
  ```
- **Running CLI commands:**
  ```bash
  python3 esphome-lights.py --list
  ```
- **Running tests:**
  ```bash
  python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
  ```
- **Profiling:** `cpython.txt` contains cProfile output from the old
  monolithic script for reference.

## Daemon Protocol

Unix socket at `/tmp/esphome-lights.sock` (configurable via
`ESPHOME_LIGHTS_SOCKET` env var). Newline-delimited JSON.

**Request examples:**
```json
{"cmd": "list"}
{"cmd": "status"}
{"cmd": "set", "device": "living_room", "action": "on"}
{"cmd": "set", "device": "living_room", "action": "brightness", "value": "128"}
{"cmd": "set", "device": "living_room", "action": "rgb", "value": "255,0,0"}
{"cmd": "ping"}
```

**Response format:**
```json
{"ok": true, "result": "Turned ON"}
{"ok": false, "error": "Device 'kitchen' not found"}
```

## OpenClaw Integration

This project is designed as an [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)
skill. OpenClaw is a self-hosted AI gateway that bridges messaging platforms
(WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.) with AI agents.

### How It Fits

```
User (WhatsApp/Telegram/etc.)
  → OpenClaw Gateway
    → Agent (with exec tool)
      → esphome-lights.py --set living_room --on
        → ESPHome device
```

- The `SKILL.md` at the repo root registers ESPHome Lights as an OpenClaw skill.
- The OpenClaw agent reads the skill definition and uses its `exec` tool to run
  CLI commands.
- Natural-language requests like *"turn on the living room"* are translated to
  the appropriate `esphome-lights.py` invocation automatically.
- OpenClaw's cron system can schedule automated light control (e.g. lights on
  at sunset).

### Skill File

`SKILL.md` uses the AgentSkills format (YAML frontmatter + Markdown
instructions). Key metadata fields:

- `requires.bins` - binaries that must exist on `PATH`
- `requires.env` - environment variables the skill depends on
- `requires.config` - OpenClaw config keys that must be truthy

### Installation

`install.sh` handles OpenClaw skill registration automatically. To link
manually:

```bash
ln -s /path/to/ESPHome-Python ~/.openclaw/skills/esphome-lights
```

Ensure `ESPHOME_LIGHTS_*` env vars are available to the agent.

## Current State

- **Version:** 0.1.1
- **Status:** Daemon + thin CLI client architecture implemented, with user-level installer.
- The daemon (`esphome-lightsd.py`) maintains persistent connections and
  serves commands via a Unix domain socket.
- The CLI client (`esphome-lights.py`) uses only stdlib for sub-100 ms startup.
- `install.sh` installs as a systemd user service (no sudo required), checks
  for config, and offers OpenClaw skill registration.
- 49 unit tests covering daemon handlers, socket protocol, entity resolution,
  state caching, and client-daemon integration.

## Known Limitations

- **Performance not yet benchmarked** on the Luckfox Pico target hardware.
  Daemon architecture should achieve the sub-100 ms target but needs
  real-world validation.
- **Python 3.13 confirmed working** on the Luckfox Pico with
  `aioesphomeapi` 44.0.0. See the Dev Environment section for the
  `noiseprotocol` gotcha.
