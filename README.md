# ESPHome Lights

A Python CLI tool for controlling ESPHome smart lights and switches via the
native ESPHome API.  Designed as an
[OpenClaw](https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/openclaw) skill for
voice/chat-driven home automation.

**Version:** 0.0.3

## Overview

ESPHome Lights lets you turn lights on/off, set brightness, and set RGB
colours from the command line.  Devices are discovered from environment
variables — no config files to manage.

The project is being refactored from a single monolithic script into a
**persistent daemon + thin CLI client** architecture to eliminate the ~4.2 s
cold-start latency caused by importing ~295 Python modules (aioesphomeapi,
protobuf, cryptography) and performing the Noise protocol handshake on every
invocation.

### Target Architecture

```
CLI client  —(Unix socket)—>  Daemon  —(persistent ESPHome API connections)—>  Devices
```

| Component              | File                    | Purpose                              |
|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Daemon                 | `esphome-lightsd.py`    | Persistent connections, state cache  |
| CLI client             | `esphome-lights.py`     | Thin stdlib-only client, fast start  |
| systemd unit           | `esphome-lightsd.service` | Auto-start on boot               |
| OpenClaw skill         | `SKILL.md`              | Chat-driven control via OpenClaw     |

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11** (system Python 3.13 is **not** compatible with
  `aioesphomeapi` — v44.0.0 fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
  'noise'` from the Cython-compiled `noise_encryption` extension, even with
  `noiseprotocol` correctly installed)
- **`aioesphomeapi`** — installed in the Python 3.11 virtual environment
- ESPHome devices with the native API enabled and encryption keys configured

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/platima/ESPHome-Python.git
cd ESPHome-Python

# Ensure the venv has aioesphomeapi
/home/luckfox/venv/bin/pip install aioesphomeapi
```

## Device Configuration

Devices are configured via environment variables.  Each variable follows the
format:

```
ESPHOME_LIGHTS_<LOCATION>="<host>:<port>|<encryption_key>"
```

- **Location** is uppercased in the variable name and lowercased for CLI use.
- **Port** is typically `6053` (native ESPHome API).

### Example

Set variables directly or place them in a `.env` file one directory above the
script:

```bash
# In .env (or export in your shell)
ESPHOME_LIGHTS_LIVING_ROOM="10.42.40.55:6053|J+YkHH7XC+4dQwWvPoF5kaz7tP4NY4HJNTL0QyZM1Rg="
ESPHOME_LIGHTS_BEDROOM="10.42.40.56:6053|another_key_here"
```

## Usage

### Current (Monolithic Script)

```bash
# List configured lights
esphome-lights.py --list

# Show on/off state of all lights
esphome-lights.py --status

# Turn a light on or off
esphome-lights.py --set living_room --on
esphome-lights.py --set living_room --off

# Set brightness (0–255)
esphome-lights.py --set living_room --brightness 128

# Set RGB colour (r,g,b — each 0–255)
esphome-lights.py --set living_room --rgb 255,0,0
```

### Flags

| Flag                   | Effect                                      |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `--bg`, `--background` | Fire and forget — return immediately        |
| `--debug`              | Wait for completion, show detailed results  |

### Planned (Daemon Mode)

Once the daemon refactor is complete, the CLI interface stays the same but
commands respond in under 100 ms.  An additional health check is available:

```bash
esphome-lights.py --ping    # Returns "pong" if daemon is running
```

## Entity Handling

- Prefers **`LightInfo`** entities for brightness and RGB control.
- Falls back to **`SwitchInfo`** for simple on/off devices (smart plugs, etc.).
- Always skips entities with `object_id == 'status_led'`.
- Brightness and RGB commands return errors for switch-type entities.

## Daemon Architecture (Planned)

### Protocol

The daemon listens on a Unix socket (`/tmp/esphome-lights.sock` by default,
configurable via `ESPHOME_LIGHTS_SOCKET`).  Communication uses
newline-delimited JSON.

**Requests:**

```json
{"cmd": "list"}
{"cmd": "status"}
{"cmd": "set", "device": "living_room", "action": "on"}
{"cmd": "set", "device": "living_room", "action": "brightness", "value": "128"}
{"cmd": "set", "device": "living_room", "action": "rgb", "value": "255,0,0"}
{"cmd": "ping"}
```

**Responses:**

```json
{"ok": true, "result": "Turned ON"}
{"ok": false, "error": "Device 'kitchen' not found"}
{"ok": true, "result": "pong"}
```

### systemd

A systemd unit file (`esphome-lightsd.service`) is provided for auto-starting
the daemon on boot:

```bash
sudo cp esphome-lightsd.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now esphome-lightsd
```

### Performance Targets

| Metric                  | Current | Target    |
|-------------------------|---------|-----------|
| `--set` command         | ~4.2 s  | < 100 ms  |
| `--status` (all devices)| ~5–8 s  | < 50 ms   |
| `--list`                | ~1.5 s  | < 50 ms   |
| CLI client startup      | ~1.5 s  | < 30 ms   |

## OpenClaw Integration

ESPHome Lights is designed as an [OpenClaw](https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/openclaw)
skill, enabling chat-driven smart home control from any messaging platform
(WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, etc.).

### How It Works

```
User (WhatsApp/Telegram/etc.)
  → OpenClaw Gateway
    → Agent (with exec tool)
      → esphome-lights.py --set living_room --on
        → ESPHome device
```

The OpenClaw agent reads the `SKILL.md` file to understand available commands,
then uses its `exec` tool to run `esphome-lights.py` with the appropriate
flags.  Natural-language requests like *"turn on the living room light"* are
translated to CLI commands automatically.

### Skill Installation

The `SKILL.md` file at the repository root registers ESPHome Lights as an
OpenClaw skill.  To install:

1. Clone this repository into your OpenClaw workspace's `skills/` directory,
   or symlink it:
   ```bash
   ln -s /path/to/ESPHome-Python ~/.openclaw/skills/esphome-lights
   ```
2. Ensure `ESPHOME_LIGHTS_*` environment variables are available to the
   OpenClaw agent (via the skill's env config or the agent's environment).
3. The skill will appear in the agent's skill list automatically.

### Automation Examples

With OpenClaw's cron system, you can schedule light control:

```bash
# Turn on living room at sunset (example: 6 PM daily)
openclaw cron add \
  --name "Lights on at sunset" \
  --cron "0 18 * * *" \
  --tz "Australia/Melbourne" \
  --session isolated \
  --message "Turn on the living room light" \
  --announce
```

## Deployment Target

This project is designed to run on a **Luckfox Pico** (ARM Linux SBC) — a
resource-constrained device.  The daemon architecture is deliberately kept
simple with no heavy frameworks.
