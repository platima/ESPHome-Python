# TODO.md — Persistent Task Tracker

This file is the persistent plan across sessions. If a session is lost, the
next session picks up from here.

## Future / Nice to Have

- [ ] Benchmark daemon performance on the Luckfox Pico target hardware.
- [ ] Evaluate Python 3.14 free-threaded support for async performance gains.
- [ ] Test OpenClaw skill loading against a live OpenClaw agent.
- [ ] Add `.gitattributes` to enforce LF line endings for `*.sh` files.

## Performance Targets

| Metric                  | Old (monolithic) | Target    |
|-------------------------|------------------|-----------|
| `--set` command (cold)  | ~4.2 s           | < 100 ms  |
| `--status` (all devices)| ~5–8 s           | < 50 ms   |
| `--list`                | ~1.5 s           | < 50 ms   |
| CLI client startup      | ~1.5 s           | < 30 ms   |

## Completed

### Phase 0: Foundation

- [x] Initial monolithic `esphome-lights.py` (working)
- [x] Create CLAUDE.md with full project context
- [x] Review daemon implementation plan
- [x] Create TODO.md (this file)
- [x] Create README.md
- [x] Create OpenClaw SKILL.md
- [x] Research `aioesphomeapi` Python 3.13 compatibility — resolved upstream
      in v44.0.0 (Feb 2026); update docs accordingly
- [x] Document Python 3.13 incompatibility root cause (Cython noise_encryption)
- [x] Confirm Python 3.13 working on Luckfox Pico — fix: `pip install
      --force-reinstall noiseprotocol` after any `pip uninstall noise`

### Phase 1: Daemon + CLI Refactor (v0.1.0)

- [x] Scaffold `esphome-lightsd.py` with shebang and docstring
- [x] Implement `.env` loading (same logic as current script)
- [x] Implement `load_devices()` from `ESPHOME_LIGHTS_*` env vars
- [x] Create Unix socket listener (`/tmp/esphome-lights.sock`, configurable
      via `ESPHOME_LIGHTS_SOCKET` env var, permissions `0o660`)
- [x] Handle stale socket file on startup (check and remove before `bind()`)
- [x] Establish persistent `aioesphomeapi` connections to all devices on startup
      (concurrent via `asyncio.gather()`)
- [x] Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
      (1 s, 2 s, 4 s, 8 s, max 30 s)
- [x] Track per-device connection state (connected / connecting / disconnected)
- [x] Subscribe to entity state changes on each connection
- [x] Maintain in-memory state cache
      (`{device: {state, brightness, rgb, entity_type}}`)
- [x] Implement JSON command handler for all commands:
  - [x] `list` — return configured devices
  - [x] `status` — return cached state for all devices
  - [x] `set` with actions: `on`, `off`, `brightness`, `rgb`
  - [x] `ping` — health check (return `pong`)
- [x] Handle multiple concurrent client connections
- [x] Implement graceful shutdown (SIGTERM, SIGINT): disconnect clients,
      remove socket file
- [x] Error handling: unreachable devices on startup, disconnected device
      commands, client socket errors
- [x] Entity handling: prefer `LightInfo` over `SwitchInfo`, skip `status_led`,
      reject brightness/RGB for switch entities
- [x] Rewrite CLI as thin stdlib-only client (`socket`, `json`, `sys`, `argparse`)
- [x] Preserve existing CLI interface: `--list`, `--status`, `--set`,
      `--on/--off/--brightness/--rgb`, `--bg`, `--debug`, `--ping`
- [x] Create `esphome-lightsd.service` systemd unit file
- [x] Create unit tests (49 tests: daemon handlers, socket protocol,
      entity resolution, state caching, client-daemon integration)
- [x] Update README.md, CLAUDE.md, TODO.md
- [x] Bump VERSION to 0.1.0

### Phase 2: OpenClaw + Code Quality (v0.1.1)

- [x] Create `SKILL.md` for OpenClaw skill registration
- [x] Document OpenClaw integration in README
- [x] Code review merge: surface entity type (light/switch) in `--list`
      and `--status` output; enrich `--status` with brightness/RGB for ON lights
- [x] Add `install.sh`: one-line user-level installer (no sudo required)
  - Refuses to run as root
  - Installs to `~/.local/lib/esphome-lights/` with `~/.local/bin/` symlinks
  - Generates systemd user service with socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`
  - Enables `loginctl linger` for boot-time start
  - Checks `~/.config/esphome-lights/env`, offers template creation
  - Detects `~/.openclaw` and offers skill registration
- [x] Fix README/CLAUDE.md/SKILL.md typography (em-dashes, double spaces,
      broken URLs)
- [x] Update SKILL.md output descriptions for entity type and light details
- [x] Bump VERSION to 0.1.1
